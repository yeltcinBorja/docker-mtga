# docker-mtga

<img src="images/magic.png">

The docker image that allows you to play Magic The Gathering Arena on Linux

Basically I got tired of deleting and cleaning up the MTGA Install every time the MTGALauncher needs to update itself, which in most of the cases breaking Wine

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yeltcinBorja/docker-mtga.git
cd docker-mtga
docker build -t yeltcinBorja/docker-mtga .
```
